## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Paste a YouTube video URL in the web app.
2. The app downloads the video transcript using `yt-dlp`.
3. Transcript text is chunked and processed with Gemini for NLP tasks.
4. Key concepts are extracted and turned into Q\&A-style flashcards.
5. Flashcards are displayed interactively in the web interface.
